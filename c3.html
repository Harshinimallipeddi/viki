    <p>Chai Xiao Qi (Wan Peng) is an alien woman from a farawaay planet. When she lands in her spacecraft on Earth, she comes across Fang Leng (Bie Thassapak Hsu), a handsome, control-freak CEO, whose car has crashed and is about to explode. She uses her superhuman powers to save him from the blast, but it takes its toll on her – leading her to lose a homing device that she needs in order to return home. Now she is stuck on Earth and forced to pretend she is a normal earthling – when in fact she is anything but. To add to the trouble, she finds she is uncontrollably attracted to human male hormones.<br>
Fang Leng, meanwhile, cannot remember what happened to him on the night of the accident. He also suffers from a strange form of amnesia that leads him to forget the women he knows when it rains. Chai Xiao Qi’s quest to retrieve her device leads her back to Fang Leng. Over time, the duo becomes attracted to one another. Can a man – and an overbearing man with such a strange predicament at that – really fall for an extraterrestrial being? And what will happen when Fang Leng’s half-brother Fang Lie (Wang You Jun) also develops a crush on Chai Xiao Qi?<br>

“My Girlfriend Is an Alien” is a 2019 Chinese drama series that was directed by Deng Ke and Gao Zong Kai.</p>
