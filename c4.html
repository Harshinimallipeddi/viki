    <p>Qiao Jing Jing (Dilraba Dilmurat) is a top-billing star who has prided herself on having an impeccable reputation. Everyone believes she cannot put a foot wrong and excels at everything she does, and she is happy to let the public think just that. But the illusion of perfection could be set to shatter for her when a video of her playing an online video game starts to circulate online. The video shows her playing abysmally. Suddenly, she finds herself in trouble when a company starts to reconsider a lucrative endorsement deal contract with the game’s developer.<br>
In a desperate bid to save the deal, she decides to prove her gaming mettle by entering a prominent gaming competition. To ensure she does well at the competition, she is forced to look for a coach – which eventually means she must reunite with her former classmate-turned aerospace engineer and gamer Yu Tu (Yang Yang). Back in school, she used to have a crush on him, but now she wants his help. Can he help her save the deal – and could their reunion have unexpected consequences?
