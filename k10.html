    <p>Lee Young Joon (Park Seo Joon) might be the vice-president of his family’s massively successful company, but that doesn’t mean he has what it takes to do a good job. Accompanied by his incredibly talented secretary, Kim Mi So (Park Min Young) for nine years, she has made him look like the shining star that Young Joon believes he is.
But after Mi So suddenly decides to quit, her arrogant boss comes to realize that he can’t live without her. Having unknowingly shared a traumatic childhood experience, the pair come to understand that maybe they do belong together after all.
With jealousy forming over Young Joon’s older brother, Lee Sung Yeon (Lee Tae Hwan), and his growing relationship with Kim Mi So, the boastful executive decides he has to win back his secretary no matter what..</p>
