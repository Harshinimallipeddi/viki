    <p>All who have ever felt self-conscious about their appearance will find a kindred soul in Im Joo Kyung (Moon Ga Young). Although cheery about most things, Joo Kyung is secretly leading a double life when it comes to her appearance.<br>
Thanks to the help of internet beauty tutorials, Joo Kyung has mastered the art of makeup and transforms into a beautiful goddess with the skillful application of cosmetics every day. She’s known as one of the most attractive girls in class. Despite this, she lives with the fear that her classmates will discover her true appearance behind makeup.<br>
The only person in school who knows her ugly secret is Lee Su Ho (Cha Eun Woo), an all-star student with natural good looks and a talent for basketball to boot. Dashingly handsome, Su Ho has captured the hearts of all the girls in the high school.<br>
However, Joo Kyung is not the only one with secrets. Su Ho has a few of his own from his past that are slowly but surely catching up to him.
Drawn together, these two individuals not only begin to uncover each other’s secrets but also learn more about their true selves in the process.<br>
The True Beauty drama is based on a long-running Webtoon that goes by the name “The Secret of Angel (True Beauty)”, penned by Yaongyi.</p>
