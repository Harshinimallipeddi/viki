    <p>The world at your feet and the weight of the world on your shoulders - children of the super-elite class bear the burden of success as they are being groomed as heirs to their family business empires despite only being in high school.<br>
Kim Tan (Lee Min Ho) is the heir to the Empire Group, a family conglomerate business, but he lives under the constant shadow of his older half-brother, Kim Won (Choi Jin Hyuk), who is already an accomplished young executive in the family business. Despite being betrothed to the wealthy and haughty Rachel Ryu (Kim Ji Won), a hotel heiress, Tan falls in love with Cha Eun Sang (Park Shin Hye), the daughter of his family’s housekeeper.<br>
Eun Sang and her best friend, Yoon Chan Young (Kang Min Hyuk), the son of Empire Group’s secretary, did not grow up like their families’ employer did, but they get embroiled in their lives nonetheless. Eun Sang gets caught in a love triangle with Tan and Choi Young Do (Kim Woo Bin), the condescending heir to a luxury resort conglomerate, while Chan Young falls in love with Tan’s ex-girlfriend, Lee Bo Na (Krystal Jung), the socialite daughter of a major entertainment executive. Can a romance survive between the haves and the have-nots?<br>
