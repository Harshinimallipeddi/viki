    <p>Saet Byul (Kim Yoo Jung) is the 22-year old elder daughter to taekwondo master Jung Chul Min (Ryu Seung Soo). While training one day, Choi Dae Hyun (Ji Chang Wook) saves Saet Byul from a falling sandbag and it’s love at first sight for her. One day, Dae Hyun encounters Saet Byul but he doesn’t recognize her. Saet Byul tries to convince Dae Hyun to buy her cigarettes, but she gets candy and a lecture instead. She gives him a kiss for caring, and they never see each other again.
Several years later, Dae Hyun is a corporate employee doing PR for GS25, a major convenience store chain. One day, his girlfriend and manager Yoo Yeon Joo (Han Sun Hwa) becomes embroiled in a police investigation. He decides to take the rap, but is forced to give up his office job and become a store manager. His store’s finances are poor, however, and he decides to try to freshen things up by hiring a new part-time worker.<br>
Enter Saet Byul, who applies for the job and finally gets it after Dae Hyun initially refuses. When Yeon Joo caught wind of the beautiful new part-timer hired for the store, she wasn’t too pleased. She was even more insecure after seeing Saet Byul’s beauty and the affectionate way she gazes at Dae Hyun. She started seeing Saet Byul as a threat and wanted her fired. However, Dae Hyun refused, seeing how Saet Byul attracts customers to the store.
Can Yeon Joo finally oust Saet Byul from Dae Hyun’s life? Or will Saet Byul succeed in winning Dae Hyun’s affection after all these years?</p>
