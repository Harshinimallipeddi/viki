    <p>Times may have been a little simpler, less technological, but still just as challenging to get through a typical day of life in the late 1980s. Five childhood friends, who all live in the same Ssangmundong neighborhood of Seoul, lean on each other to survive their challenging teen years and set a path for their futures. Sung Deok Sun (Hyeri) struggles for attention as the middle child in her poor family while also carrying the burden of her 989th ranking in school. Kim Jung Hwan (Ryu Jun Yeol) only has a one-track mind for soccer, even after his family becomes rich overnight. Sung Sun Woo (Ko Gyung Pyo) is the perfect student, student council president and a caring and dependable son in his family. Ryu Dong Ryong (Lee Dong Hwi) is a geek who knows more about girls and life than the rest of his friends, but his poor academic score prevents him from being able to go to college. <br>Choi Taek (Park Bo Gum) is a genius baduk player who dropped out of school to go professional. As the group of friends get into and out of mischief around the neighborhood, what experiences from these memorable times together will they carry with them into their future lives? “Reply 1988” is a 2015-2016 South Korean drama series directed by Shin Won Ho. The series is inspired by the drama “Three Families Under One Roof,” which originally aired from 1986 to 1994. It is the third series of the nostalgia-themed “Reply” dramas that include “Reply 1997” (2012) and “Reply 1994” (2013), but the characters and stories are not related to the previous series.</p>
